### Hi, I'm Georgina! ðŸ‘‹

- :sparkles: About me:  
After working in education for just under a decade I took some time away to travel around New Zealand. Now I'm back and I'm diving into the world of tech!  
:pushpin: I am based in the UK   

- :mortar_board: Education and Training:  
I have a BA in Archaeology and a Masters Degree in Classics and Ancient History.  I am currently a Trainee DevOps Engineer with Sparta Global.  

- :sunrise_over_mountains: Hobbies:  
Anything that gets me outdoors! I love climbing and hiking with my dog, Hector!  
I spend a lot of time underground exploring caves all over the world.
